## Creative Coding + AI II: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

The images I took were of a few of the guitars in my collection. I have a love of the Les Paul guitar shape because thats what my favorite guitarists played on during my favorite era of theirs which is why I chose two of my Les Pauls. I also used pictures of my Coronet guitar for variety. The masks highlight each guitar in the pictures. To start with, I made the first masks for the initial images using photopea. Then I ran those images through the provided code to get the output. The other images (input_newX.jpg) were processed using an AI model that I wrote as I wasn't able to submit photos for processing into the folder in time due to personal reasons. The AI model I wrote takes the images I had and their masks, as well as the images and masks I could get my hands on that were provided in the modules. I then manipulated those images with different combinations of rotation and flipping to give the AI more training images to get a more accurate output image. I tried a few times with that AI model and had chatGPT assist in coming up with ways to make the model more accurate. This code is all provided in the zip file. After running the code a few times and updating it to increase accuracy, I finally got some masks that were usable. I ran those and the input_newX images through the code to get the output.
